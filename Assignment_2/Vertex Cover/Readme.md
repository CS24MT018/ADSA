Let's break down the provided example and how the 2-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover operates on this graph.

### Graph Details
The graph is described as follows:

```
5 10
0 1
0 4
0 3
0 2
1 2
1 3
1 4
2 3
2 4
3 4
```

- **Number of vertices (`n`)**: 5
- **Number of edges (`m`)**: 10
- **Edges**:
  - (0, 1)
  - (0, 4)
  - (0, 3)
  - (0, 2)
  - (1, 2)
  - (1, 3)
  - (1, 4)
  - (2, 3)
  - (2, 4)
  - (3, 4)

### Applying the 2-Approximation Algorithm

The 2-approximation algorithm iterates over the vertices and selects edges to include in the vertex cover, ensuring that each selected edge's endpoints are included in the cover. Here's how it works step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We start with all vertices unvisited.
   - The vertex cover is initially empty.

2. **Iteration**:

   - **Start with vertex 0**:
     - **Edge (0, 1)**: 
       - Neither vertex 0 nor vertex 1 is visited.
       - Add both 0 and 1 to the vertex cover.
       - Mark both 0 and 1 as visited.
       - Move to the next vertex.

   - **Next vertex 1**:
     - Vertex 1 is already visited, so skip it.
     - Move to the next vertex.

   - **Next vertex 2**:
     - **Edge (2, 3)**:
       - Neither vertex 2 nor vertex 3 is visited.
       - Add both 2 and 3 to the vertex cover.
       - Mark both 2 and 3 as visited.
       - Move to the next vertex.

   - **Next vertex 3**:
     - Vertex 3 is already visited, so skip it.
     - Move to the next vertex.

   - **Next vertex 4**:
     - **Edge (4, 0)**:
       - Vertex 4 is unvisited, but vertex 0 is visited.
       - Move to the next edge of 4.
     - **Edge (4, 2)**:
       - Both vertices are visited, so skip it.
     - **Edge (4, 3)**:
       - Both vertices are visited, so skip it.
     - Vertex 4 has no unvisited adjacent vertices, so no further action.

### Final Vertex Cover

The algorithm will stop once all vertices have been considered. The vertex cover will include the following vertices:

- **Vertices included in the vertex cover**: {0, 1, 2, 3}

**Final Vertex Cover**: 0, 1, 2, 3

### Explanation:

- **Correctness**: Every edge in the graph is covered by at least one endpoint in the vertex cover. The vertices chosen guarantee that every edge has been "covered."
- **Approximation Guarantee**: The size of this vertex cover is 4. The optimal vertex cover for this specific graph might also be 4, but if there were a smaller cover, the algorithm guarantees the cover found is at most twice the size of the optimal cover.

### Edge-by-Edge Coverage

Let's check how the vertex cover (0, 1, 2, 3) covers all the edges:

- **Edges covered by (0, 1)**:
  - (0, 1) — covered.
  - (0, 4) — covered by vertex 0.
  - (0, 3) — covered by vertex 0.
  - (0, 2) — covered by vertex 0.

- **Edges covered by (2, 3)**:
  - (2, 3) — covered.
  - (1, 2) — covered by vertex 2.
  - (1, 3) — covered by vertex 3.
  - (2, 4) — covered by vertex 2.
  - (3, 4) — covered by vertex 3.

Thus, every edge is covered by the selected vertices (0, 1, 2, 3).

### Conclusion

The 2-approximation algorithm effectively finds a vertex cover by greedily selecting edges and marking their endpoints. This ensures that the size of the cover is at most twice the size of the optimal cover, providing a computationally feasible solution to this NP-hard problem. In this specific graph, the chosen vertex cover is efficient and small, illustrating the algorithm's effectiveness.
