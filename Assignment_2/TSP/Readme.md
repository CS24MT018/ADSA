Let's walk through the 2-approximation algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the provided example in detail. We'll go step-by-step to understand how the algorithm works and how it handles the given input.

### Input Details

```
5 10
0 1 1
0 2 2
0 3 2
0 4 2
1 2 1
1 3 1
1 4 1
2 3 1
2 4 1
3 4 2
```

- **Number of vertices (`V`)**: 5
- **Number of edges (`E`)**: 10
- **Edges with weights**:
  - (0, 1) with weight 1
  - (0, 2) with weight 2
  - (0, 3) with weight 2
  - (0, 4) with weight 2
  - (1, 2) with weight 1
  - (1, 3) with weight 1
  - (1, 4) with weight 1
  - (2, 3) with weight 1
  - (2, 4) with weight 1
  - (3, 4) with weight 2

### Step 1: Graph Representation
First, we represent the graph as an adjacency list where each vertex has a list of pairs representing its neighbors and the corresponding edge weights.

The adjacency list will look like this:

```
0: (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 2)
1: (0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
2: (0, 2), (1, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1)
3: (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (4, 2)
4: (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2)
```

### Step 2: Generate a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

We use Prim's algorithm to generate the MST. The idea is to start from an arbitrary vertex (in this case, vertex 0) and build the MST step-by-step by adding the smallest edge that connects a new vertex to the growing MST.

#### Prim's Algorithm Execution:

1. **Start with vertex 0**:
   - Include vertex 0 in the MST.
   - Choose the smallest edge from vertex 0's neighbors: (0, 1) with weight 1.

2. **Add vertex 1**:
   - Include vertex 1 in the MST.
   - Choose the smallest edge that connects to a new vertex: (1, 2) with weight 1.

3. **Add vertex 2**:
   - Include vertex 2 in the MST.
   - Choose the smallest edge that connects to a new vertex: (1, 3) with weight 1.

4. **Add vertex 3**:
   - Include vertex 3 in the MST.
   - Choose the smallest edge that connects to a new vertex: (1, 4) with weight 1.

5. **Add vertex 4**:
   - All vertices are now included in the MST.

The resulting MST is:

```
0 -- 1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4
Edges:
(0, 1) with weight 1
(1, 2) with weight 1
(1, 3) with weight 1
(1, 4) with weight 1
```

### Step 3: Perform a Pre-order Walk of the MST

Next, we perform a pre-order traversal of the MST starting from vertex 0. In a pre-order traversal, we visit the current vertex and then recursively visit all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet.

#### Pre-order Traversal Execution:

1. **Start at vertex 0**:
   - Visit vertex 0.
   - Move to vertex 1 (connected by edge (0, 1)).

2. **Visit vertex 1**:
   - Visit vertex 1.
   - Move to vertex 2 (connected by edge (1, 2)).

3. **Visit vertex 2**:
   - Visit vertex 2.
   - Move to vertex 3 (connected by edge (2, 3)).

4. **Visit vertex 3**:
   - Visit vertex 3.
   - Move to vertex 4 (connected by edge (3, 4)).

5. **Visit vertex 4**:
   - Visit vertex 4.
   - All vertices are visited, so the traversal is complete.

The resulting pre-order traversal tour is:

```
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
```

### Step 4: Convert to a Hamiltonian Circuit

To get a valid TSP tour, we need to return to the starting vertex (vertex 0) to complete the cycle.

The TSP tour becomes:

```
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0
```

### Step 5: Calculate the Tour Cost

Now, we calculate the total cost of the tour:

- **Cost of (0, 1)**: 1
- **Cost of (1, 2)**: 1
- **Cost of (2, 3)**: 1
- **Cost of (3, 4)**: 2
- **Cost of (4, 0)**: 2

**Total Cost**: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 7

### Final Output

The 2-approximation algorithm returns the following TSP tour and cost:

- **TSP Tour**: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0
- **Tour Cost**: 7

### Summary

- **Input Graph**: 5 vertices and 10 edges with varying weights.
- **MST**: Constructed using Prim's algorithm, with minimal weight connections.
- **Pre-order Traversal**: Gives a sequence of visits for the tour.
- **TSP Tour**: The tour visits all vertices and returns to the start, with a total cost calculated from the edge weights.

This algorithm efficiently produces a TSP solution that is at most twice the optimal cost, adhering to the triangle inequality principle.
